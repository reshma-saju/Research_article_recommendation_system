We discuss a series of scenarios for the experimentally observed zero
temperature pseudogap phase and show how present and future RF experiments may
help in its elucidation. We conclude that the MIT experiments at the lowest $T$
may well reflect ground state properties, but take issue with their claim that
the pairing gap survives up to temperatures of the order of the degeneracy
temperature $T_F$ at unitarity.

The naive lowest energy

accompanying symmetry hierarchy contains hints of standard model phenomenology.

driven by a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst index 1/2<H<1, which is
analogous to the linear self-attracting diffusion. For 1-dimensional process we
study its convergence and the corresponding weighted local time. For
2-dimensional process, as a related problem, we show that the renormalized
self-intersection local time exists in L^2 if $\frac12<H<\frac3{4}$.

  clustering","16 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in ApJ, minor changes
  in the last few sentences of the discussion",,10.1086/526412,,astro-ph,,"  We study galaxy mergers using a high-resolution cosmological hydro/N-body
simulation with star formation, and compare the measured merger timescales with
theoretical predictions based on the Chandrasekhar formula. In contrast to
Navarro et al., our numerical results indicate, that the commonly used equation
for the merger timescale given by Lacey and Cole, systematically underestimates
the merger timescales for minor mergers and overestimates those for major
mergers. This behavior is partly explained by the poor performance of their
expression for the Coulomb logarithm, \ln (m_pri/m_sat). The two alternative
forms \ln (1+m_pri/m_sat) and 1/2\ln [1+(m_pri/m_sat)^2] for the Coulomb
logarithm can account for the mass dependence of merger timescale successfully,
but both of them underestimate the merger time scale by a factor 2. Since \ln
(1+m_pri/m_sat) represents the mass dependence slightly better we adopt this
expression for the Coulomb logarithm. Furthermore, we find that the dependence
of the merger timescale on the circularity parameter \epsilon is much weaker
than the widely adopted power-law \epsilon^{0.78}, whereas
0.94*{\epsilon}^{0.60}+0.60 provides a good match to the data. Based on these
findings, we present an accurate and convenient fitting formula for the merger
timescale of galaxies in cold dark matter models.

  characterization of Evershed clouds",Accepted for publication in A&A,,10.1051/0004-6361:20077819,,astro-ph,,"  [Abridged] The magnetic and kinematic properties of the photospheric Evershed
flow are relatively well known, but we are still far from a complete
understanding of its nature. The evolution of the flow with time, which is
mainly due to appearance of velocity packets called Evershed clouds (ECs), may
provide information to further constrain its origin. Here we undertake a
detailed analysis of the evolution of the Evershed flow by studying the
properties of ECs. In this first paper we determine the sizes, proper motions,
location in the penumbra, and frequency of appearance of ECs, as well as their
typical Doppler velocities, linear and circular polarization signals, Stokes V
area asymmetries, and continuum intensities. High-cadence, high-resolution,
full vector spectropolarimetric measurements in visible and infrared lines are
used to derive these parameters. We find that ECs appear in the mid penumbra
and propage outward along filaments with large linear polarization signals and
enhanced Evershed flows. The frequency of appearance of ECs varies between 15
and 40 minutes in different filaments. ECs exhibit the largest Doppler
velocities and linear-to-circular polarization ratios of the whole penumbra. In
addition, lines formed deeper in the atmosphere show larger Doppler velocities,
much in the same way as the ''quiescent'' Evershed flow. According to our
observations, ECs can be classified in two groups: type I ECs, which vanish in
the outer penumbra, and type II ECs, which cross the outer penumbral boundary
and enter the sunspot moat. Most of the observed ECs belong to type I. On
average, type II ECs can be detected as velocity structures outside of the spot
for only about 14 min. Their proper motions in the moat are significantly
reduced with respect to the ones they had in the penumbra.

determine the $\eta-\eta^{\prime}$ mixing angle. We calculate not only the
factorizable contribution in QCD facorization scheme but also the
nonfactorizable hard spectator corrections in pQCD approach. We get the
branching ratio of $B\to J/\Psi \eta$ which is consistent with recent
experimental data and predict the branching ratio of $B\to J/\Psi
\eta^{\prime}$ to be $7.59\times 10^{-6}$. Two methods for determining
$\eta-\eta^{\prime}$ mixing angle are suggested in this paper. For the first
method, we get the $\eta-\eta^{\prime}$ mixing angle to be about
$-13.1^{\circ}$, which is in consistency with others in the literature. The
second method depends on less parameters so can be used to determine the
$\eta-\eta^{\prime}$ mixing angle with better accuracy but needs, as an input,
the branching ratio for $B\to J/\Psi \eta^{\prime}$which should be measured in
the near future.

fluctuations of the zero point field may lead to a breakdown of the
superluminal quantum correlations over very large distances. A phenomenological
model that was proposed by Winterberg to estimate the transition scale of the
conjectured breakdown, does not lead to a distance that is large enough to be
agreeable with recent experiments. We consider, but rule out, the possibility
of a steeper slope in the energy spectrum of the turbulent fluctuations, due to
compressibility, as a possible mechanism that may lead to an increased
lower-bound for the transition scale. Instead, we argue that Winterberg
overestimated the intensity of the ZPF turbulent fluctuations. We calculate a
very generous corrected lower bound for the transition distance which is
consistent with current experiments.

  Late-Type, Gas Rich, Spiral Galaxy",,,10.1086/521645,,astro-ph,,"  We present ""On The Fly"" maps of the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) emission covering a
10' X 10' region of the NGC 6946. Using our CO maps and archival VLA HI
observations we create a total gas surface density map, Sigma_gas, for NGC
6946. The predominantly molecular inner gas disk transitions smoothly into an
atomic outer gas disk, with equivalent atomic and molecular gas surface
densities at R = 3.5' (6 kpc). We estimate that the total H2 mass is 3 X 10^9
Mo, roughly 1/3 of the interstellar hydrogen gas mass, and about 2% of the
dynamical mass of the galaxy at our assumed distance of 6 Mpc. The value of the
CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) line ratio ranges from 0.35 to 2; 50% of the map is covered by
very high ratio, >1, gas. The very high ratios are predominantly from interarm
regions and appear to indicate the presence of wide-spread optically thin gas.
Star formation tracers are better correlated with the total neutral gas disk
than with the molecular gas by itself implying SFR is proportional to
Sigma_gas. Using the 100 FIR and 21 cm continuum from NGC 6946 as star
formation tracers, we arrive at a gas consumption timescale of 2.8 Gyr, which
is relatively uniform across the disk. The high star formation rate at the
nucleus appears to be due to a large accumulation of molecular gas rather than
a large increase in the star formation efficiency. The mid-plane gas pressure
in the outer (R > 10 kpc) HI arms of NGC 6946 is close to the value at the
radial limit (10 kpc) of our observed CO disk. If the mid-plane gas pressure is
a factor for the formation of molecular clouds, these outer HI gas arms should
contain molecular gas which we do not see because they are beyond our detection
limit.
